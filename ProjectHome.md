# FryingPan, an Amiga Optical Disc Recording Software #

This software relies heavily on an additional package, Amiga Generic framework, which was created to uniform all variations of our fantastic system.

This repository includes COMPLETE solution (FryingPan, accompanying libraries and low level engine and the Generic framework).

The sources have been opened for the sole benefit of **all** of those, who feel they could:
  * use it,
  * learn from it,
  * help with it.

Please spare me comments such as _I would have done this better_ etc. If you really think so, you would have done that by now.

The code has been released under **GNU Lesser Public License**. This means that you can use it in a binary form as you please, but if you decide to make modifications to it directly, you are obliged to share your modifications with the rest of community (=us).

The Source Code has been migrated mostly from SourceForge, where the projects have been marked as _Moved_. **Optical** is the last missing piece that has been added to the package.
